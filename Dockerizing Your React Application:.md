# Dockerizing Your React Application: A Beginner’s Guide

With the increasing complexity of web applications and the demand for fast and reliable deployment, containerization has become an essential part of modern application development. Docker, one of the most popular containerization platforms, provides an easy and efficient way to package applications into containers, allowing for quick and easy deployment.

In this article, we’ll explore how to use Docker to deploy a React app, providing a step-by-step guide for creating and deploying a Docker container for a React app.


Step 1: Create a React App Before we start containerizing our React app, we need to create a React app. If you already have a React app, you can skip this step.

To create a new React app, we can run the following command in our terminal:

`npx create-react-app my-app`

Step 2: First of all create a file named .dockerignore in the root directory, Essentially, the .dockerignore file tells Docker which files and directories to exclude from the build context so that Docker only includes the necessary files and dependencies for the application.

Now to Dockerize the React App, we need to create a Docker container. To do this, we need to create a Dockerfile in the root directory of our app.

A Dockerfile is a script that contains instructions for building a Docker image. In our case, we want to create an image that includes our React app and all its dependencies.

Here’s an example Dockerfile that we can use for our React app:
```
##### Base image
FROM node:16-alpine

##### Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

##### Copy package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package.json ./

##### Install dependencies
RUN npm install --silent

##### Copy the app
COPY . ./

##### Build the app
RUN npm run build

##### Serve the app
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

Let’s go through the different parts of this Dockerfile:

`FROM node:16-alpine` - This sets the base image for our container, Node.js 16 on the Alpine Linux distribution.

`WORKDIR /app` - This sets the working directory for our container to /app.

`COPY package*.json ./` - This copies the package.json and package-lock.json files from our local directory to the /app directory in the container.

`RUN npm install --silent `- This installs all the dependencies for our app in the container.

`COPY . ./ `- This copies the rest of the files in our local directory to the /app directory in the container.

`RUN npm run build` - This builds the React app using the npm run build command.

`CMD ["npm", "start"]` - This starts the app using the npm start command.

Step 3: Build the Docker Image Now that we have our Dockerfile, we can build our Docker image by running the following command in our terminal:

`docker build -t my-react-app .`

This will create a Docker image named my-react-app based on the instructions in our Dockerfile.

Step 4: Run the Docker Container With our Docker image built, we can now run our Docker container by running the following command in our terminal:

`docker run -p 3000:3000 my-react-app`

This will start our container and map port 3000 in the container to port 3000 on our local machine.

This guide covered the steps for containerizing a React application using Docker. It delved into the process of dockerizing a React app and explored the essential codes and files required for the task.
